\title{Create a test set}
\usage{
create_testset(intensity_data, area, first_day, n_weeks = 2,
  n_sample = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{intensity_data}{object of class \code{sf} with point geometry, containing the
locations and times of all pick-ups in the bike sharing system.}

\item{area}{object of class \code{sf}, with polygon geometry, representing the
service area of the bike sharing system.}

\item{first_day}{character specifying the first day of the test set period.
Should be in the format 'YYYY-mm-dd'.}

\item{n_weeks}{the length in weeks of the test set period.}

\item{n_sample}{the size of the sample for each week.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{sf}, with point geometry
}
\description{
A test set is created inside the function by sampling 'location, time of the day,
day of the week'-combinations from a dataframe with all the pick ups in the
historical data from the bike sharing system. The days of the week from those
combinations are translated into the same days of the week in the test set period.
