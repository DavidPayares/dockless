\usage{
build_models(data, weeks_of_data = 12, last_day = NULL,
  auto_seasonality = TRUE, seasons = list(NULL, 96, 672, c(96, 672)),
  window = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{object of class \code{dockless_dfc}.}

\item{weeks_of_data}{how many weeks of historical data to use for model building.}

\item{last_day}{character specifying the last day of the model building period.
Should be in the format 'YYYY-mm-dd'. If set to NULL, the last day of the data
is used.}

\item{auto_seasonality}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the seasonal period of each
time series will be automatically determined with time series cross-validation.}

\item{seasons}{if \code{auto_seasonality} is set to \code{TRUE}: a list of
different seasonal period lengths - or, in the case of multiple seasonality,
combinations of seasonal period lenghts - in time lags to be tested for in
the time series cross-validation. No seasonality should be represented by
\code{NULL}. If \code{auto_seasonality} is set to \code{FALSE}: a list of
seasonal period lengths - or, in the case of multiple seasonality,
combinations of seasonal period lenghts - in time lags to be used for each
of the time series. No seasonality should be represented by \code{NULL}. The
list should be of the same length as the number of time series in the
\code{dockless_dfc} object.}

\item{window}{rolling window for time series cross validation, in weeks.
Ignored when \code{auto_seasonality} is set to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of models, one for each \code{dockless_df} time series.
Each model is an object of class \code{ARIMA} for non-seasonal data and an
object of class \code{stlm} for seasonal data. Both classes come from the
\code{forecast} package.
}
\description{
Fits a forecasting model on each \code{dockless_df} time series in a
\code{dockless_dfc}. For non-seasonal time series, an ARIMA model will
be fitted on the log transformed data. For seasonal time series, the log
transformed data will be decomposed with STL decomposition, and an ARIMA
model will be fitted on the seasonally adjusted data.
